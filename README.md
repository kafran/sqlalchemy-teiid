# SQLAlchemy TEIID Dialect

This is a fork from https://github.com/ryncsn/sqlalchemy-teiid. I restructured the project folders for use in projects of Brazil's Ministry of Economy. I also fixed some minor issues about TEIID version. This is a working solution to use Python to connect to the service called DaaS (also known as Quartzo) from the public company SERPRO.
