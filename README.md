# SQLAlchemy TEIID Dialect

This is a fork from https://github.com/ryncsn/sqlalchemy-teiid. I restructured the project a little bit. I'm trying to implement the table reflection feature.

This is also useful for projects running on TEIID prior to version 8.12 when TEIID didn't return the correct Postgres version. This has been already fixed: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-4866.
